Problem Statement:

In a particular board game, a player has to try to advance through a sequence of positions.
Each position has a nonnegative integer associated with it, representing the maximum number 
of steps you can advance from that position in one move. The game starts at the first position,
and the player wins by reaching the last position.

For example, let A = (3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1) represent the board game, where each entry in A
denotes the maximum number of steps we can advance from that position. In this case, the game
can be won by following this sequence of advances through A: take 1 step from A[0] to A[1],
then 3 steps from A[1] to A[4], and finally 2 steps from A[4] to A[6], which is the last position.
It is worth noting that A[0] = 3, A[1] = 3, and A[4] = 2, so all moves are valid.

However, if A was instead (3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1), it would not be possible to advance past position 3.
Therefore, the game cannot be won.

Write a program that takes an array of n integers, where A[i] represents the maximum number of steps
you can advance from index i. The program should return whether it is possible to reach the last index
starting from the beginning of the array.
